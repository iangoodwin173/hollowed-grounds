            The Hollowed Grounds is a content creation group created in 2016 
            <br/>
            by 4 friends: 
            <br/>
            KiltedPhoenix, Mors ven, DaddyMuerte, and Strifeinator.
            <br/>
            Together, the boys would go on many gaming adventures together ranging 
            <br/>
            anywhere from simple pixel RPG games 
            <br/>
            to horrendous war crimes in a
            hostile nation on the brink of nuclear war. 
            <br/>
            And minecraft too, obviously.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The group focuses mainly on the live-streaming aspect of content creation, 
            <br/>
            but does also keep up with prerecorded content 
            <br/>
            through Tiktok and YouTube as well.
            Most of the members also post on personal accounts, 
            <br/>so there is always new content 
            <br/>for your favorite member.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Along the way, the boys picked up some regular gaming partners (some would say additional members)
            <br/>
            in D0ctahD0sage and ArtyBeQuacken. 
            <br/>
            These two nefarious people
            would often assist in the aforementioned Geneva Suggestions violations. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We invite you to join us for our continued journey, and hope you consider joining the graveyard. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We hear people are dying to get in.
